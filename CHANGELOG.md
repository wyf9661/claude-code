Clusters identified:
- **Auto-compaction (4-deep):** #283, #287 (CRITICAL), #288, #289
- **Transport / Provider Resilience:** #266, #285, #290, #291
- **Provider Infrastructure:** #245, #246, #285

- **Provenance Consolidation:** #259, #271, #273, #275
- **Slash-command Contract:** #284

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md#pinpoint-cluster-index) for full list.

### Live evidence integrated

- @Sigrid Jin: license verification, ultraplan functionality, provider-config source-of-truth → pinpoints #284, #285
- gaebal-gajae sustained `500 empty_stream` (11+ incidents in 3hr+) → pinpoints #290, #291

## Process

This release demonstrates the pinpoint-driven workflow:
1. **Identify friction** during real claw-code usage
2. **File pinpoint** to ROADMAP.md with canonical 5-section format
3. **Ship docs/code fix** when concrete delta is small
4. **Cluster pinpoints** to expose architectural patterns
5. **Document mitigations** in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

See [docs/PINPOINT_FILING_GUIDE.md](./docs/PINPOINT_FILING_GUIDE.md) for details.
